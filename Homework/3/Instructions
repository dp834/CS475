Your third project is one where you are responsible for reverse engineering a malicious IoT device.
You have the datasheet on the processor, a hypothetical machine called the S20, but that's all you have to go on.
The attached document describes the instruction set and shows an example of the assembly language format and the machine code format.

Your first step in the analysis is to write a disassembler for the machine.
I recommend approaching the assignment in two phases.
In the first phase, just directly disassemble all the words in the binary file.
This will result in nop instructions being output for the three data items at the end.
In the second phase trace the code execution starting at address 0, and disassemble only the basic blocks that are reachable by the code.
Other words, should be labeled as data.
